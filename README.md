# VUMCHandWashing
# 1. Description
According to the World Health Organization, thousands of people around the world die everyday from infections contracted WHILE RECEIVING health care. These types of transmissions are often due to insufficient hand hygiene because hands are the primary vehicle for germ transmission. In 2003, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) kicked off their hand hygiene awareness program to improve efforts by health care workers to follow proper hand washing protocol. They began manual auditing of hand hygiene in 2008, which improved compliance rates from 58% to 88% by 2011. In 2011, a basic mobile application further increased compliance at VUMC to 96%.

Vanderbilt University Hand Washing is a comprehensive web app created for the purposes of preventing patient to patient infection transmission across various locations. While previous implementations were made specifically for in-house use, this app was built from the ground up to support access from satellite offices, clinics, remote locations, etc. Specified "observers" spread across the medical center (or other sites) have access to the app allowing them to record data on various hygienic practices; hand washing/scrubbing being the primary measure of hygiene compliance. This simple, straightforward, and uncluttered app allows "observers" to quickly and easily chart and submit data on hygienic compliance. In addition to data gathering functionality, this application includes options to both view and filter results in an appropriate fashion: using charts and graphs filteres by various criteria.
#2. Checkout, build, and run
Install the latest version of XCode.

Check out the code from: https://github.com/astonking/VUMCHandWashing/tree/dev

You can test it using XCode's built in iOS simulator (top left drop down)

Run the simulator by pressing the play button (also in the top left)

Using valid credentials (tbd), you can sign into the application taking you to the home screen

From here you can navigate three large buttons specified for "New Observation", "Location", "Statistics"

New Observation allows you to select appropriate options in the observation (i.e. hands washed, contact precautions, gloves worn, gown worn, etc.)

Location will allow you to choose you current location in the hospital. (This is tentative, potentially unnecessary)

Statistic will allow you to view stats on observation data. Drop down menus allow you to filter results based on: time, location (tentative), and observations.
