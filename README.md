# VUMCHandWashing
# 1. Description
Vanderbilt University Hand Washing is a comprehensive application created for the purposes of auditing hand washing throughout the medical center. Certain "observers" spread across the medical center will have access to the app allowing them to record data on of various hygienic practices; hand washing will be the primary measure of hygiene compliance. This app will be simple, straightforward, and uncluttered, allowing "observers" to quickly and easily chart and submit data on hygienic compliance. In addition to the data gathering functionality, the application will also include options to view and filter results in an appropriate fashion: using charts, graphs, or diagrams. This additional graphical analysis will be out of the way and may be limited to certain admin accounts.
#2. Checkout, build, and run
Install the latest version of XCode.

Check out the code from: https://github.com/astonking/VUMCHandWashing/tree/dev

You can test it using XCode's built in iOS simulator (top left drop down)

Run the simulator by pressing the play button (also in the top left)

Using valid credentials (tbd), you can sign into the application taking you to the home screen

From here you can navigate three large buttons specified for "New Observation", "Location", "Statistics"

New Observation allows you to select appropriate options in the observation (i.e. hands washed, contact precautions, gloves worn, gown worn, etc.)

Location will allow you to choose you current location in the hospital. (This is tentative, potentially unnecessary)

Statistic will allow you to view stats on observation data. Drop down menus allow you to filter results based on: time, location (tentative), and observations.
